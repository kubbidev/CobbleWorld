   - Adjustment: Modify the voice's port and other configurations as needed.

2. BlueMap Server Settings
   - File: binaries/config.zip/bluemap/webserver.conf
   - Adjustment: Modify the webserver's port and other configurations as needed.

3. Server Properties
   - File: server.properties
   - Adjustment: Make sure the server port and other server settings are correct for your setup.

Please ensure that all changes are made carefully to avoid any configuration conflicts or errors when deploying the server.
