Server Configuration Notes

This server configuration has been optimized for our machines.
If you're planning to install it on your own server, you may need to adjust the following settings:

1. VoiceChat Server Settings
   - File: packages/config.zip/voicechat/voicechat-server.properties
   - Adjustment: Modify the voice's port and other configurations as needed.

2. Server Properties
   - File: server.properties
   - Adjustment: Make sure the server port and other server settings are correct for your setup.

Note:
Please ensure that all changes are made carefully to avoid any configuration conflicts or errors when deploying the server.
